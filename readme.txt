
Project Boomtown: 

Our inspiration was the millions of Americans with internet insecurities and the difficulties they have with finding work and upward social mobility. We are also aware of the difficulties of being a small business owner (especially a sole proprietor) with minimal support. BoomTown uses an SMS based platform to connect business owners with the temporary staff they need. The platform gives an equal opportunity to individuals without a reliable internet connection.
